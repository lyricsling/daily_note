# cmake项目包含 glfw 的过程，待验证
With a few changes to your CMakeLists.txt you can locate the package and target files generated when GLFW is installed.

find_package(glfw3 3.4 REQUIRED)
Once GLFW has been added to the project, link against it with the glfw target. This adds the GLFW library and its link-time dependencies, the include directory for the GLFW header and, when applicable, the GLFW_DLL macro.

target_link_libraries(myapp glfw)
Note that the glfw target does not depend on OpenGL, as GLFW loads any OpenGL, OpenGL ES or Vulkan libraries it needs at runtime. If your application calls OpenGL directly, instead of using a modern extension loader library, use the OpenGL CMake package.

find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
If OpenGL is found, the OpenGL::GL target is added to your project, containing library and include directory paths. Link against this like any other library.

target_link_libraries(myapp OpenGL::GL)
或者
target_link_libraries(myapp OpenGL::GL glfw)
